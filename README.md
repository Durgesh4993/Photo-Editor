# About Photo-Editor
This photo editing application is one of those elegantly powerful PHP project ideas that blend JavaScript and PHP to produce a web app for users to create beautiful digital artwork. This PHP project also forces you to use object-oriented programming, which is a great way to hone these skills.

Using XAMPP, you’ll provide an array of tools for users to draw whatever they want! At the center of this project is the ‘brush tool’, allowing users to select various colors and brush sizes to produce creative drawings.
